# MovieSharing

This project was created during an internship at TDSoftware based in Jena, Germany.

The application is displaying the playlists with its videos from a defined user via channel-id (mine for demonstration) in two different views (grid and list). It is also possible to see details for a video and add the video to favorites, which then adds it to a searchable list of all favorites.

The main goal of this project was to get used to the businesses best practices in terms of architecture and general way of problem solving, as well as improving the own understanding of Frontend-Android-development.

Notes:
- design and functionality was given
- the application is not optimized for tablets
