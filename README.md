# MovieSharing

This project was created during an internship at TDSoftware based in Jena, Germany. This is a simple application, 
that gives a user the possibility of seeing playlists from YouTube in different views (grid and list), but also enables him to see details 
to a movie and give it a rating (stars) and add it as a favorite.

The main goal of this project was to get used to the businesses best practices in terms of architecture and general way of problem solving.

Notes:

- design and functionality was given

- the application is fetching playlists from a given channel

- the application is not optimized for tablets/ all screensizes
